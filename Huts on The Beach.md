[[Jack]] has become more savage, he is wearing nothing but his shorts, his hair has grown, he's described using animal terms (like a dog, on all fours, hissing in air)

"two light blue eyes... ready to tun to anger" is forshadowing for in chapter 3 when his eyes "seemed bolting and
nearly mad"

When [[Jack]] is first introduced he is posh "Their bodies, from throat to ankle, were hidden by black cloaks... finished off with a hambone frill" 
but by chapter 3 he is already turning more and more savage "...except for a pair of tattered shorts held up by his knife-belt he was naked.", "dog-like"

On pages 64-65 [[Jack]] and [[Ralph]] are arguing over what has higher priority, [[hunting]] or building a [[shelter]]. On pages 68-69 they give up the big argument and move on to a more productive conversation "baffled, in love and hate". This also reminds us they are just children.

The little kids represent [[society]] as a whole.
